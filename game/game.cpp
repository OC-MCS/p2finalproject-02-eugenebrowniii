//=========================================================

// This is just the starting point for your final project.

// You are expected to modify and add classes/files as needed.

// The code below is the original code for our first graphics

// project (moving the little green ship). 

//========================================================

#include <iostream>

// Assignment: Final Project

//============================================================



// note: a Sprite represents an image on screen. A sprite knows and remembers its own position

// ship.move(offsetX, offsetY) adds offsetX, offsetY to 

// the current position of the ship. 

// x is horizontal, y is vertical. 

// 0,0 is in the UPPER LEFT of the screen, y increases DOWN the screen

	// Limit the framerate to 60 frames per second

	window.setFramerateLimit(60);



	Game game(window);

	GameUI gameUI(&game, window);

		// For now, we just need this so we can click on the window and close it

		Event event;

			// "close requested" event: we close the window

			if (event.type == Event::Closed)

				window.close();

			else if (event.type == Event::MouseButtonReleased)

				// maybe they just clicked on one of the settings "buttons"

				// check for this and handle it.

		//===========================================================

		// Everything from here to the end of the loop is where you put your

		// code to produce ONE frame of the animation. The next iteration of the loop will

		// render the next frame, and so on. All this happens ~ 60 times/second.

		//===========================================================



		gameUI.draw(window);



		// end the current frame; this makes everything that we have 

		// already "drawn" actually show up on the screen

		window.display();



		// At this point the frame we have built is now visible on screen.

		// Now control will go back to the top of the animation loop

		// to build the next frame. Since we begin by drawing the

		// background, each frame is rebuilt from scratch.



	} // end body of animation loop
